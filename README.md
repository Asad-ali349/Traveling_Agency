## About Project

"Creative Incentive" is a Laravel Web Application designed to facilitate travel agencies in effectively managing their clientele and reservations for the Umrah pilgrimage. The application encompasses a comprehensive range of services, comprising the following categories:

Package

Lodging

Flight

VISA

Transport


Clients have the ability to make reservations for these services, with additional optional services also available for selection. Initially, administrators are responsible for configuring these services, specifying their associated selling or procurement prices based on customer demographics, including child, infant, and adult classifications. Notably, the pricing for package services is inherently linked to the lodging and flight components, ensuring automatic synchronization of package costs.

The reservation process seamlessly integrates these services, with the application automatically computing the cumulative cost based on the chosen services and their respective pricing. Moreover, the application features an integral accounting module, affording administrators the capacity to track the sales of services and ascertain profit margins meticulously. Within the accounting module, administrators can generate invoices and receipts, subsequently facilitating the issuance of tangible documents.

In sum, Creative Incentive is a pivotal tool for travel agencies, streamlining the intricacies of reservation management, service pricing, and financial tracking, all within a singular, user-friendly interface.
